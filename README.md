# Duck
Duck (Funny)

Basically one big coding language that just uses duck as its keyword, uses ascii for text and is pretty hard to understand. I dont even know how I made this myself.

this is just a funny project I had, dont take it too seriously. I  mean, it's written in python for godness sake.

also most stuff probably will not work as I have been debugging this thing ever since I created it. I made this in one night after pulling 3 all nighters and no longer know how anything works so good luck.

msg me if u have any requests @ RetractedShark2#7833 on Discord (Ill probs link it if I can)
